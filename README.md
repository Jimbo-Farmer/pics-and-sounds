# Pictures and Sounds

## Description 

A friend that works with less-able children asked if I could create a simple app to display pictures of, for example, animals or vehicles together with the sounds that they make. 

The children she works with typically do not have a very long attention span, so the app will allow the user to dive straight into the images and sounds. Images will be divided by category, accessible from a simple menu. 

The screen will display several images at once to increase intrigue and visual stimulation. Clicking on an image will cause it to expand to fill the screen and play the sound clip. Clicking again will shrink the image back to original size.

## Dependencies
